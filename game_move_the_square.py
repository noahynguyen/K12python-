"""
Move the Player - A Simple Pygame Project

Description:
-------------
This program creates a game window using pygame. A blue square (the "player") is displayed on the screen.
The player can be moved using the arrow keys: left, right, up, and down.

How to Play:
-------------
- Use the arrow keys:
    → LEFT: move left
    → RIGHT: move right
    → UP: move up
    → DOWN: move down
- Close the game window (click the 'X') to quit the game.

What You’ll Learn:
-------------------
- How to set up a basic pygame window
- How to draw shapes on the screen
- How to handle keyboard input
- How to update the display in a loop

Make sure pygame is installed:
    pip install pygame
