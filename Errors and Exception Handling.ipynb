    "## Why Do We Need to Handle Exceptions?\n",
    "\n",
    "In any program, unexpected problems can occur. These problems, called **exceptions**, might include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dividing a number by zero\n",
    "- Trying to open a file that does not exist\n",
    "- Using a variable that hasn’t been defined\n",
    "- Giving the wrong type of data to a function (like adding a string to a number)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we do not handle these exceptions, the program will stop running and show an error. This is not a good experience for users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasons to Handle Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **To prevent the program from crashing**  \n",
    "   Handling exceptions allows the program to keep running even when something goes wrong. Instead of crashing, the program can show a helpful message to the user or try something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **To help users understand what went wrong**  \n",
    "   We can display friendly messages like “Please enter a number” instead of a confusing error like `ValueError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **To make the program safer and more reliable**  \n",
    "   Handling exceptions makes your program more stable and professional. It shows that you've thought about what might go wrong and prepared for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **To allow retry or backup plans**  \n",
    "   If something fails (like a file not opening), we can give the user another chance to try again or choose a different option.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "If someone enters a word instead of a number:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"That’s not a number! Please try again.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the `try...except`, the program would crash. With exception handling, it gives the user another chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling exceptions is an important part of writing strong and user-friendly programs.\n"
